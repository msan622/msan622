## Instructions ##

The following packages must be installed prior to running this code:

- `ggplot2`
- `shiny`
- `scales`

To run this code, please enter the following commands in R:


`library(shiny)` </br>
`shiny::runGitHub('msan622', 'rasmirac', subdir = 'homework2')`
</br>
**Note**: This takes a few minutes to bring up the browser --  I'm not sure why. 

This will start the `shiny` app. See below for details on how to interact with the visualization.
