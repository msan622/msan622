![Plot 1](hw1-scatter.png)
<p align="center"> In this plot, I modified the default label for the y axis, and transformed the labels for the x-axis. I also used the alpha parameter to make the points more transparent. This makes overlapping points easier to see. I also edited the text size as it was showing up rather large on GitHub. </p>


![Plot 2](hw1-bar.png)
<p align="center"> I used a little more customization in this plot. I took away the legend, axis titles, x-axis ticks, and vertical grid lines. I also increased the text size for the genre labels on the x-axis and decreased the padding of the plot. Further, I created a custom palette based on the genres. </p>


![Plot 3](hw1-multiples.png)
<p align="center"> Again, I used my custom palette for the genres. I also increased the size of the space between the facets to make the x-axis labels easier to read. Again, I transformed the x-axis labels, and created custom breaks for the y-axis. </p>

![Plot 4](hw1-multiline.png)
<p align="center"> I created custom breaks for the x-axis. Again, I made the text size slightly smaller. I also labeled the legend. </p>
